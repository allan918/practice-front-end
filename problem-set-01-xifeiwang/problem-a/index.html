        Itachi Uchiha is a character from the Anime named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">Naruto</a>.
        Itachi was a prodigy of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan and also served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an
        international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards
        joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent
        conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke — who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi.
        Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his
        actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, remaining a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to
        the very end.
